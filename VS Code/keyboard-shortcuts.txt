Run Selected Text in Active Terminal

Press Ctrl+K+S to open File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Search for workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText in keybindings. Press the icon on the left to open a windnow with this message "Press desired key combination..." and make your choice.

I've pressed Ctrl+Alt+R - as this combination was not used yet. Press Enter to store your keybinding

Now it's supported by default shortcut "shift" + "enter".
