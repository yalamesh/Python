4.max()& min()
The min() and max() functions are used to get the minimum value and the maximum value from the sequences respectively.
print(min([5,3,2,1]))
print(max([5,3,2,1]))
5.len()
The len() function is very handy when you want to know the length of the sequence.

The index() method searches an element in the sequence and returns the index of the first occurrence.
